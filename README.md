# RL experiments

The repository contains some algorithms of Reinforcement Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. It is used as a playgroung.

## Requirements

Use virtual environment to simplify the setup process:

    virtualenv ve_rl_experiments
    pip install req_virtual_env.txt

## Implementation

Environments:

- Gridworld: "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto

Algorithms:

- Value Iteration: "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto section 4.4
